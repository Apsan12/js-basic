# JavaScript ES6+ Examples and Lessons

This small learning repo contains concise ES6+ examples and step-by-step notes.

Files you can run:

- `examples/array.js` — arrays, destructuring (arrays/objects), spread and rest operators, and common array helpers (map/filter/reduce). Runnable in Node.
- `examples/async.js` — promises, async/await, Promise.all and error handling examples. Runnable in Node.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
node examples\array.js
node examples\async.js
```

What you'll learn here:

- Basic and practical uses of arrays and destructuring.
- Spread operator for arrays/objects and rest parameters for functions.
- Core async patterns: Promises and async/await.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add more small files for other topics (modules, classes, DOM-safe examples).
- Convert this README into a step-by-step lesson set (multiple markdown files).
- Scaffold a tiny MERN starter (server + client skeleton).

Tell me which you prefer and I'll continue.
